## This is a collaborative repo so please fork and contribute!
As I navigate my Masters in Statistics / Data Science I have seen a lot of resources along the way. 
Thinking a repo listing these resources by topic would be helpful to consolidate all these reources. 
If you have any feedback feel free to message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/moni_stats)
